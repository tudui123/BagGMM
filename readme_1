MATLAB Compiler

1. Prerequisites for Deployment 

. Verify the MATLAB Runtime is installed and ensure you    
  have installed version 9.2 (R2017a).   

. If the MATLAB Runtime is not installed, do the following:
  (1) enter
  
      >>mcrinstaller
      
      at MATLAB prompt. The MCRINSTALLER command displays the 
      location of the MATLAB Runtime installer.

  (2) run the MATLAB Runtime installer.

Or download the Windows 64-bit version of the MATLAB Runtime for R2017a 
from the MathWorks Web site by navigating to
